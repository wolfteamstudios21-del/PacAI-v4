AI Brain Core App – Version 1.1 Specification

Product Document | For Developers, Studios, and Technical Partners


---

1. Overview

The AI Brain Core is a modular, cloud-hosted intelligence engine designed to power games, simulations, virtual worlds, and adaptive NPC systems. Developers lease the AI Brain Core and use the AI Brain Mobile App (or desktop app) to configure, modify, and control how the AI behaves inside their project.

The mobile app acts as the command console for the AI system. It gives developers access to behavior trees, model settings, difficulty curves, agent logic, world-state rules, and runtime diagnostics — all without rebuilding their game.

This document describes the structure, architecture, feature set, and demo workflow of AI Brain Core App V1.1.


---

2. Product Goal

Enable developers to control, adjust, or rewrite the version of the AI Brain Core they lease, allowing them to modify:

NPC behavior patterns

Enemy and ally AI logic

Faction strategies

Difficulty scaling

World rules and environmental logic

Narrative AI prompts and generative behaviors

Reinforcement learning parameters

ONNX prediction models

Runtime variables and AI tuning values

Performance limits and safety constraints


All in real time, through a cross-platform mobile or desktop interface.


---

3. Demo Purpose (V1)

The V1 demo proves these core concepts:

1. Godot frontend → AI backend communication loop


2. Behavior Tree (BT) evaluation using the AI Brain Core structure


3. ONNX prediction (player style or NPC trait inference)


4. Prompt-based LLM logic (mocked or powered through DBos)


5. Mobile UI elements making real-time API calls


6. Configurable settings that change AI behavior on the fly



The demo represents the minimum viable example of how a leasing studio would interact with your AI Core system.

5. AI Brain Core Components

5.1 Behavior Tree System

Defines how NPCs think, choose actions, escalate threats, retreat, interact with players, and adapt.

The mobile app can:

Enable/disable BT nodes

Save and publish new BT versions to the game

Roll back to previous BT profiles



---

5.2 ONNX Inference Layer

Used for:

Player style prediction

NPC personality inference

Difficulty estimation

Risk scoring

Pathfinding weight modeling


The mobile app can:

Swap ONNX models

Change input weights

Set performance limits and frequency



---

5.3 Prompt Engine (LLM Logic)

Controls:

Narrative responses

NPC dialogue

Adaptive storytelling

World event triggers


The mobile app can:

Edit prompts

Switch models (local or cloud)

Define guardrails

9. Goal of the System

Deliver a fully configurable, enterprise-ready AI system that developers, studios, and teams can lease, control, modify, and integrate into their games — without building their own AI stack from scratch.

The AI Brain Core App becomes the interface through which every AI decision in their game can be monitored, rewritten, or tuned on demand.
